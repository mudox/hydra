Hydra is an unofficial iOS client app for GitHub. I use it to keep practicing
various technologies I learned in community.

## Project Targets

- [x] Practice UI/UX designing tool ([Sketch.app] etc.)
- [x] [MVVM] (with [RxSwift]) architecture.
- [x] Use [FRP] paradigm as much as possible, use it correctly and
      efficiently.
- [x] Stand-alone network abstraction layer ([GitHubKit]) using state-of-art
      techniques.
- [x] Utilize CI automation tools.
- [x] Experiment IB-less UI developing (i.e. no .xib, .storyboard files, only
      source code). The key is to draw out design first in dedicated tools (Omini
      Graffle.app, Sketch.app etc.)
- [ ] Localization for ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ , ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.
- [ ] Unit & UI tested with decent code coverage.

## Technologies

### Requirements

- [x] Xcode 10
- [x] Swift 4.2

### Designing

- [x] [Graffle.app] to do concept designing, like class hierarchies, reactive
      data flow of view models, dependencies graphs etc.
- [x] [Sketch.app] for static scene & artwork design.
- [ ] [Principle.app] for dynamic UI design.

### Architecture

- [x] MVVM with [RxSwift]
- [x] Flow

Simply put, flow + view model + view controller + view.

### FRP

- [x] [RxSwift] the Swift implementation of [ReactiveX].
- [x] [RxSwiftExt] as extension library for [RxSwift].
- [x] [RxDataSources] + [RxRealmDataSources] to drive table views and collection views.
- [x] [Action] to bridge between background transactions and UI states.
- [x] [RxGesture] to install and use gesture recognizers reactively.
- [ ] [RxTheme] to implement theme switching.

### Network

The network stack listed from bottom to top:

- [x] [URLSession] Foundation URL loading system.
- [x] [Alamofire] + [RxAlamofire] for simple request case.
- [x] [Moya] to construct network abstraction layer.
- [x] [RxSwift] to provide reactive interface.

### Data Model

- [x] [SwiftyUserDefaults] to access UserDefaults type-safely.
- [x] [Realm] + [RxRealm] to construct local data model layer.
- [x] [Valet] to store user password and app authorization token into Keychain.

### UI

- [x] [Kingfisher] + [RxKingfisher] to manage images loading.
- [ ] [Texture] to optimize essential UI components.
- [ ] [Hero] to provide vivid transitions between view controllers.

### Testing

- [x] [Swinject] + [SwinjectAutoregistration] to inject dependencies.
- [x] [OHHTTPStubs] to stub network requests.
- [x] [Quick] + [Nimble] + [RxNimble] to as basic unit testing frameworks.
- [x] [RxTest] + [RxBlocking] to write view model white tests.
- [x] [EarlGray] to write in-process integration tests.

### Code quality

- [x] [SwiftFormat] to prettify Swift code.
- [x] [SwiftLint] to keep code's quality.

### CI

- [x] [fastlane] to automate development steps.
- [x] [Travis CI] as CI provider.
- [x] [codecov.io] as code coverage service.
- [x] [Code Climate] to keep code maintainability.
- [ ] [Danger] to automate pull request managements and other developing chores.

### My Own Libraries

- [x] [JacKit] for better logging.
- [x] [GitHubKit] as main part of data model layer, which is a Swift client
      of GitHub APIv3.
- [x] [MudoxKit] as my own iOS tool belt library.
- [x] [SocialKit] for social sharing.

### Other

- [ ] [Sourcery] to get rid of flow boilderplates.
